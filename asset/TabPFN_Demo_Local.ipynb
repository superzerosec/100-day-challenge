        "TabPFN is a novel machine learning model that is exceptionally fast and requires no hyperparameter tuning. It is particularly powerful for tabular data, which is a common data format in many real-world applications. This notebook will not only demonstrate how to use TabPFN but also provide clear explanations of the underlying concepts.\n",
